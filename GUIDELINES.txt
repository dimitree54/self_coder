Style guidelines:
Follow flake8 style guide.
All function should have both input and output type hints.
Internal function variables should not have type hints.
If it is not clear from function name and type hints, what the function does, add a short docstring.
Simple function with clear name and arguments should not have docstring.
Do not use obvious docstrings, add arguments to docstring only if they are not clear from type hints and name.
Docstrings should explain what the function does, not how it does it.

Architecture guidelines:
Avoid using global variables and package-level variables.
Avoid using computations on package level.
Follow the best development practices, such as single responsibility principle, etc.
Functions should be short and do only one thing.
When extending functionality, make sure that the old functionality not changed.
For example, when adding new argument to function, use default value for it, saving old behaviour when used without new argument.
Avoid implementing functionality that exist in well-known libraries.
